### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Step 1: Executing the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**  
   The function is an immediately invoked async function. The following steps occur inside this function.

2. **Step 2: `Promise.all([])`**  
   - `Promise.all([])` is called with an empty array.
   - `Promise.all()` resolves immediately when called with an empty array, since there are no promises to wait for.
   - **Console Output:** `[]`

3. **Step 3: `Promise.all([1, 2, Promise.resolve(3), Promise.resolve(4)])`**  
   - `Promise.all()` is called with a list of values: `1`, `2`, `Promise.resolve(3)`, and `Promise.resolve(4)`.
   - The numbers `1` and `2` are treated as resolved values (since they're not promises).
   - The resolved values of `Promise.resolve(3)` and `Promise.resolve(4)` are `3` and `4`, respectively.
   - Since all values are either resolved promises or regular values, `Promise.all()` resolves with the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - **Console Output:** `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

4. **Step 4: `Promise.all([1, 2, Promise.resolve(3), Promise.reject('error')])`**  
   - `Promise.all()` is called with `1`, `2`, `Promise.resolve(3)`, and `Promise.reject('error')`.
   - As before, `1` and `2` are treated as resolved values, and `Promise.resolve(3)` resolves to `3`.
   - However, `Promise.reject('error')` rejects the promise with the string `'error'`.
   - Since `Promise.all()` rejects as soon as any promise in the array rejects, it immediately rejects with the reason `'error'`.
   - **Console Output:** `'error'`

### Final Console Output:

### Key Points:
- `Promise.all([])` resolves immediately with an empty array when provided with no promises.
- `Promise.all()` resolves when all promises in the array are resolved, returning an array of their resolved values.
- `Promise.all()` rejects as soon as any promise in the array is rejected, and no further promises are processed.
