## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. **`let a = 1; console.log(a +++ a)`**
- JavaScript will interpret `+++` as `++ +`.
  - The `++` operator increments the value of `a` (pre-increment).
  - The `+` in the middle is the addition operator.
- Execution flow:
  1. Pre-increment the first `a` (`++a`): `a` becomes `2`.
  2. Add the incremented `a` (which is `2`) to the second `a` (which is still `2`).
- **Output**: `4`

### 2. **`let b = 1; console.log(b + + + b)`**
- JavaScript will interpret `+ + +` as `+ + +`.
  - The first `+` is the addition operator.
  - The second and third `+` are unary plus operators (which try to convert the value to a number).
- Execution flow:
  1. The first `b` is `1`.
  2. The second `b` is coerced to a number by the unary plus operator, which is already `1`.
  3. Addition takes place: `1 + 1 = 2`.
- **Output**: `2`

### 3. **`let c = 1; console.log(c --- c)`**
- JavaScript will interpret `---` as `-- -`.
  - The `--` operator decrements the value of `c` (pre-decrement).
  - The `-` in the middle is the subtraction operator.
- Execution flow:
  1. Pre-decrement the first `c` (`--c`): `c` becomes `0`.
  2. Subtract the second `c` (which is `0` now).
  3. Result: `0 - 0 = 0`.
- **Output**: `0`

### 4. **`let d = 1; console.log(d - - - d)`**
- JavaScript will interpret `- - -` as `- - -`.
  - The first two `-` are unary minus operators, which convert the sign of the value.
  - The third `-` is the subtraction operator.
- Execution flow:
  1. The first `d` is `1`.
  2. The second `d` is negated twice, so it remains `1`.
  3. Subtraction takes place: `1 - 1 = 0`.
- **Output**: `0`
