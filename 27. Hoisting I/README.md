## Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Expression: `const a = 1`**
   - The constant `a` is declared and initialized with the value `1`.
   - No output.

2. **Expression: `console.log(a)`**
   - The value of `a` is logged.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Expression: `var b`**
   - The variable `b` is declared using `var`, but not initialized. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted with the value `undefined`.
   - No output.

4. **Expression: `console.log(b)`**
   - Since `b` was declared but not initialized, the value logged is `undefined`.
   - Output: `undefined`

5. **Expression: `b = 2`**
   - The variable `b` is now initialized with the value `2`.
   - No output.

6. **Expression: `console.log(c)`**
   - The variable `c` is declared with `var` but not yet initialized at this point, so it is hoisted with a value of `undefined`.
   - Output: `undefined`

7. **Expression: `var c = 3`**
   - The variable `c` is now initialized with the value `3`.
   - No output.

8. **Expression: `console.log(d)`**
   - `let d` is in the "temporal dead zone" from the start of its block until the declaration is encountered, so trying to access `d` before initialization throws a `ReferenceError`.
   - Output: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'd' before initialization`

9. **Expression: `let d = 2`**
   - This line would initialize `d` with the value `2`, but it is never reached due to the error.
   - No output.
