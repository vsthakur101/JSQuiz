## Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Expression: `[1] == 1`**
   - The array `[1]` is coerced to a primitive type (string `"1"`), and the comparison becomes `"1" == 1`.
   - Then, `"1"` is coerced to a number, so the comparison becomes `1 == 1`.
   - Result: `true`

2. **Expression: `[1] == '1'`**
   - The array `[1]` is coerced to the string `"1"`, so the comparison becomes `"1" == '1'`.
   - Both sides are now strings, so the comparison is true.
   - Result: `true`

3. **Expression: `['1'] == '1'`**
   - The array `['1']` is coerced to the string `"1"`, so the comparison becomes `"1" == '1'`.
   - Both sides are strings, so the comparison is true.
   - Result: `true`

4. **Expression: `['1'] == 1`**
   - The array `['1']` is coerced to the string `"1"`, and the comparison becomes `"1" == 1`.
   - Then, `"1"` is coerced to a number, so the comparison becomes `1 == 1`.
   - Result: `true`

5. **Expression: `[1] == ['1']`**
   - Both arrays are coerced to their primitive values. `[1]` becomes `"1"` and `['1']` also becomes `"1"`.
   - The comparison is now `"1" == "1"`.
   - Result: `true`

6. **Expression: `new Boolean(true) == 1`**
   - `new Boolean(true)` creates a Boolean object, which is truthy.
   - In the comparison, `new Boolean(true)` is coerced to `1`, so the comparison becomes `1 == 1`.
   - Result: `true`

7. **Expression: `new Boolean(true) == new Boolean(true)`**
   - Each `new Boolean(true)` creates a new object reference, and object references are compared by reference.
   - Since these are two different objects, the comparison is false.
   - Result: `false`

8. **Expression: `Boolean(true) == '1'`**
   - `Boolean(true)` evaluates to `true`, which is `1` in numeric coercion.
   - The comparison becomes `1 == '1'`, and the string `'1'` is coerced to a number.
   - The comparison becomes `1 == 1`.
   - Result: `true`

9. **Expression: `Boolean(false) == [0]`**
   - `Boolean(false)` evaluates to `false`, which is `0` in numeric coercion.
   - `[0]` is coerced to `"0"`, and then to `0` as a number.
   - The comparison becomes `0 == 0`.
   - Result: `true`

10. **Expression: `new Boolean(true) == '1'`**
   - `new Boolean(true)` is an object, which is coerced to `1` in numeric comparison.
   - The comparison becomes `1 == '1'`, and the string `'1'` is coerced to a number.
   - The comparison becomes `1 == 1`.
   - Result: `true`

11. **Expression: `new Boolean(false) == [0]`**
   - `new Boolean(false)` is an object, which is truthy and coerced to `1` in numeric comparison.
   - `[0]` is coerced to `"0"`, and then to `0` as a number.
   - The comparison becomes `1 == 0`, which is false.
   - Result: `false`

12. **Expression: `null == undefined`**
   - The equality comparison `==` allows `null` and `undefined` to be equal to each other, but not to anything else.
   - Result: `true`
