## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. **`console.log(obj.b())`**
- The method `b()` is called on the object `obj`.
- Inside `b()`, `this` refers to `obj`, so `this.a` is `1`.
- **Output**: `1`

### 2. **`console.log((true ? obj.b : a)())`**
- The conditional expression `true ? obj.b : a` evaluates to `obj.b` because the condition is `true`.
- When `obj.b` is executed like a standalone function, `this` inside the function no longer refers to `obj` (because it's not called on `obj` anymore).
- Therefore, `this.a` is `undefined` (since `this` refers to the global object or `undefined` in strict mode, and there's no `a` in that context).
- **Output**: `undefined`

### 3. **`console.log((true, obj.b)())`**
- The comma operator returns the last value, so `(true, obj.b)` evaluates to `obj.b`.
- As in the previous example, `obj.b` is called as a standalone function, so `this` is not bound to `obj`.
- Again, `this.a` is `undefined`.
- **Output**: `undefined`

### 4. **`console.log((3, obj['b'])())`**
- Like the previous case, the comma operator returns the last value, so `(3, obj['b'])` evaluates to `obj['b']`, which is equivalent to `obj.b`.
- When `obj.b` is called without an object reference, `this` is not bound to `obj`.
- As a result, `this.a` is `undefined`.
- **Output**: `undefined`

### 5. **`console.log((obj.b)())`**
- This expression is effectively the same as `obj.b()`.
- `this` refers to `obj`, so `this.a` is `1`.
- **Output**: `1`

### 6. **`console.log((obj.c = obj.b)())`**
- The assignment `obj.c = obj.b` assigns the method `b` to a new property `c` on the object `obj`.
- Now, `obj.c` is a reference to `obj.b`, but when it is called standalone as `(obj.c)()`, it behaves like a standalone function.
- Therefore, `this.a` is `undefined` because `this` does not refer to `obj`.
- **Output**: `undefined`
