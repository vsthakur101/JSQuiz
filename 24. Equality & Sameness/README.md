## Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Comparison: `0 == '0'`**
   - The `==` operator performs **type coercion**.
   - `'0'` (string) is converted to `0` (number).
   - After coercion, `0 == 0` evaluates to **true**.
   
2. **Comparison: `0 === '0'`**
   - The `===` operator checks for **strict equality** (both value and type).
   - `0` is a number, and `'0'` is a string.
   - Since the types are different, the comparison evaluates to **false**.

3. **Comparison: `Object.is(0, '0')`**
   - `Object.is` checks for strict equality **without type coercion**.
   - Since `0` (number) and `'0'` (string) are of different types, the comparison evaluates to **false**.

4. **Comparison: `0 == 0`**
   - The `==` operator performs value comparison.
   - Both values are `0` (same value and type).
   - This evaluates to **true**.

5. **Comparison: `0 === 0`**
   - The `===` operator checks for strict equality.
   - Both values and types are the same (`0` is a number).
   - This evaluates to **true**.

6. **Comparison: `Object.is(0, 0)`**
   - `Object.is` checks strict equality.
   - Since both values are the same (`0`), the comparison evaluates to **true**.

7. **Comparison: `0 == -0`**
   - The `==` operator treats `0` and `-0` as **equal**.
   - Therefore, this comparison evaluates to **true**.

8. **Comparison: `0 === -0`**
   - The `===` operator treats `0` and `-0` as **strictly equal**.
   - This comparison evaluates to **true**.

9. **Comparison: `Object.is(0, -0)`**
   - `Object.is` handles `0` and `-0` **differently** compared to `===`.
   - It still considers `0` and `-0` to be equal, so the comparison evaluates to **true**.

10. **Comparison: `NaN == NaN`**
    - The `==` operator checks for **loose equality**.
    - In JavaScript, `NaN` is **not equal to itself**.
    - Therefore, this evaluates to **false**.

11. **Comparison: `NaN === NaN`**
    - The `===` operator checks for **strict equality**.
    - Even with strict equality, `NaN` is **not equal to itself**.
    - This evaluates to **false**.

12. **Comparison: `Object.is(NaN, NaN)`**
    - `Object.is` handles `NaN` comparisons **differently**.
    - It treats `NaN` as **equal to itself**, so the comparison evaluates to **true**.

13. **Comparison: `0 == false`**
    - The `==` operator performs **type coercion**.
    - `false` is coerced to `0` (boolean to number).
    - This results in `0 == 0`, which evaluates to **true**.

14. **Comparison: `0 === false`**
    - The `===` operator checks for **strict equality**.
    - `0` is a number, and `false` is a boolean.
    - Since their types are different, the comparison evaluates to **false**.

15. **Comparison: `Object.is(0, false)`**
    - `Object.is` checks for strict equality **without type coercion**.
    - Since `0` and `false` are of different types, the comparison evaluates to **false**.
