1. **`console.log(1);`**
   - The number `1` is logged to the console.

2. **`const promise = new Promise((resolve) => { ... });`**
   - A new promise is created.
   - The executor function of the promise runs immediately.

3. **`console.log(2);` (inside the promise executor)**
   - The number `2` is logged to the console.

4. **`resolve();` (inside the promise executor)**
   - The promise is resolved, but the `.then()` handlers have not been attached yet, so they wonâ€™t run immediately.

5. **`console.log(3);` (inside the promise executor)**
   - The number `3` is logged to the console.

6. **`console.log(4);`**
   - The number `4` is logged to the console.

7. **`promise.then(() => { console.log(5); });`**
   - The first `.then()` is attached to the promise. The callback function will be executed once the JavaScript event loop processes the resolved promise.
   - The callback function is now queued in the microtask queue.

8. **`promise.then(() => { console.log(6); });`**
   - The second `.then()` is attached to the promise. This callback will also be executed after the first `.then()` is resolved.
   - This callback function is queued in the microtask queue after the first `.then()`.

9. **`console.log(7);`**
   - The number `7` is logged to the console.

10. **`setTimeout(() => { console.log(8); }, 10);`**
    - A `setTimeout` is set with a delay of `10` milliseconds. The callback function will be executed after the delay, and it is queued in the macrotask queue.

11. **`setTimeout(() => { console.log(9); }, 0);`**
    - Another `setTimeout` is set with a delay of `0` milliseconds. The callback function is queued in the macrotask queue.
    - Even though the delay is `0`, the callback is still executed after the current synchronous code and any queued microtasks are finished.

12. **Event Loop Execution:**
    - After all synchronous code is executed, the event loop processes the microtasks:
        - The first `.then()` callback logs `5`.
        - The second `.then()` callback logs `6`.
    - After the microtasks, the event loop processes the macrotasks:
        - The `setTimeout` with `0` delay logs `9`.
        - The `setTimeout` with `10` milliseconds delay logs `8`.
