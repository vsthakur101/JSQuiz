### Step-by-Step Execution

1. **`function a() {}`**
   - This defines a function `a` using a function declaration. The function `a` is hoisted and can be used before its declaration.
   - **No console output.**

2. **`const b = function() {}`**
   - This defines a function `b` using a function expression. Unlike function declarations, `b` is not hoisted, and it only exists after the line where it is defined.
   - **No console output.**

3. **`const c = function d() {}`**
   - This defines a function `c` that has a local name `d` within its own scope. `d` can only be accessed within the body of the function `c`.
   - **No console output.**

4. **`console.log(typeof a)`**
   - This checks the type of `a`. Since `a` is a function, the result is `"function"`.
   - **Console Output:** `function`

5. **`console.log(typeof b)`**
   - This checks the type of `b`. Since `b` is also a function, the result is `"function"`.
   - **Console Output:** `function`

6. **`console.log(typeof c)`**
   - This checks the type of `c`. Since `c` is a function, the result is `"function"`.
   - **Console Output:** `function`

7. **`console.log(typeof d)`**
   - This checks the type of `d`. However, `d` is not defined in the outer scope (outside of the function `c`), so the result is `"undefined"`.
   - **Console Output:** `undefined`

8. **`c()`**
   - Inside the `c` function (which is locally named `d`), the first `console.log(typeof d)` prints `"function"` because `d` refers to the function itself.
   - Then, an attempt is made to assign `'e'` to `d`, but this will not work because function names are immutable inside their scope.
   - The second `console.log(typeof d)` will still print `"function"` because `d` remains the function `d`.
   - **Console Output:**
     ```
     function
     function
     ```

### Final Console Output:

### Key Points:
- **Function declarations** like `a` are hoisted, meaning they can be called before their definition in the code.
- **Function expressions** like `b` are not hoisted; they are defined only when the code execution reaches their line.
- **Named function expressions** like `c` have their own local function name (`d`), which is only accessible within the function itself.
- The function name `d` cannot be reassigned within the function scopeâ€”it remains a reference to the function.
