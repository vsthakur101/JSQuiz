1. **`Promise.resolve(1)`**
   - This creates a promise that is immediately fulfilled with the value `1`.

2. **`.then(() => 2)`**
   - The first `.then()` is called with an `onFulfilled` function `() => 2`.

3. **Return Value from `() => 2`**
   - This function doesn't use the value `1` from the previous promise but instead returns `2`.

4. **Fulfillment of the First `.then()`**
   - The promise returned from this `.then()` is fulfilled with the value `2`.

5. **`.then(3)`**
   - The second `.then()` is called with `3`, which is **not a function**.

6. **Identity Function Substitution**
   - Since `3` is not a function, JavaScript replaces it with the identity function `(x) => x`, meaning the value `2` is passed through unchanged.

7. **Fulfillment of the Second `.then()`**
   - The promise returned from this `.then()` is fulfilled with the value `2`.

8. **`.then((value) => value * 3)`**
   - The third `.then()` is called with a function `(value) => value * 3`.

9. **Return Value from `(value) => value * 3`**
   - This function takes the value `2` from the previous promise and multiplies it by `3`, returning `6`.

10. **Fulfillment of the Third `.then()`**
    - The promise returned from this `.then()` is fulfilled with the value `6`.

11. **`.then(Promise.resolve(4))`**
    - The fourth `.then()` is called with `Promise.resolve(4)`, which is **not a function**.

12. **Identity Function Substitution Again**
    - Since `Promise.resolve(4)` is not a function, JavaScript replaces it with the identity function `(x) => x`, passing the value `6` through unchanged.

13. **Fulfillment of the Fourth `.then()`**
    - The promise returned from this `.then()` is fulfilled with the value `6`.

14. **`.then(console.log)`**
    - The fifth `.then()` is called with the `console.log` function.

15. **Logging the Value**
    - The `console.log` function is called with the value `6`, which is printed to the console.
