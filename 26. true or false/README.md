## Step-by-Step Execution

1. **Expression: `console.log([] == 0)`**
   - The `==` operator performs type coercion. `[]` is coerced to an empty string `""`, and `0` is also coerced to `""`.
   - Comparison: `"" == 0` becomes `true`.
   - Output: `true`

2. **Expression: `console.log([] == false)`**
   - `==` operator coerces `[]` to `false`. Both `[]` and `false` are coerced to `""` and compared.
   - Output: `true`

3. **Expression: `console.log(!![])`**
   - `[]` is a truthy value. The `!!` operator converts a value to its boolean equivalent.
   - Output: `true`

4. **Expression: `console.log([1] == 1)`**
   - `[1]` is coerced to `1` during comparison.
   - Output: `true`

5. **Expression: `console.log(!![1])`**
   - `[1]` is a truthy value, and `!!` converts it to its boolean equivalent.
   - Output: `true`

6. **Expression: `console.log(Boolean([]))`**
   - The empty array `[]` is a truthy value, and `Boolean([])` converts it to `true`.
   - Output: `true`

7. **Expression: `console.log(Boolean(new Boolean([])))`**
   - `new Boolean([])` creates a Boolean object which is always truthy, regardless of its content.
   - Output: `true`

8. **Expression: `console.log(Boolean(new Boolean(false)))`**
   - `new Boolean(false)` creates a Boolean object which is truthy, even though it wraps a `false` value.
   - Output: `true`
